5. **Enhanced About page** - full timeline with certifications, real background details
6. **Redesigned Homepage** - authentic story instead of generic automation copy

### Content Strategy
- **NO fake demos or broken links** - everything marked as "Internal/Private project" if not public
- **Real metrics and impact** - actual hours saved, systems built, results achieved
- **Authentic story telling** - physics background → international experience → language business → strategic AI pivot
- **Professional but personal** - shows expertise without being corporate

## User Preferences (Important!)
- **Step-by-step approach**: Only provide first step, wait for confirmation before proceeding
- **Human-like communication**: Short sentences, avoid AI-sounding terms, no dashes (—), casual and friendly tone
- **Critical thinking**: Don't just affirm - be an intellectual partner, challenge assumptions
- **French/English bilingual** context
- **Career transition story**: From linguist to AI automation specialist

- **Routing**: React Router DOM with proper 404 handling
- **Deployment**: Vercel with automatic builds
- **Environment**: OpenAI API key required for chat functionality
- **Design**: All components follow the established futuristic design system

**Key Success Factors**: This portfolio works because it shows REAL work, tells an authentic story, and demonstrates actual technical capabilities rather than just talking about them. The AI chat feature is a perfect example - it's not just a gimmick, it's a functional demonstration of AI integration skills.
